This is a web application I created as a Flatiron School of Engineering student, as part of the SQL/ActiveRecord/ORM/MVC/Sinatra module.

The Covid-19 Symptom Tracker is a Model-View-Controller Sinatra application that allows a user to sign up, log in, create a case, read/view their case, edit the symptoms of their case, and delete their case (CRUD).

The symptoms are accurately captured as defined by the CDC, and can be referenced here: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html
